# EBitEngine Qosmos
A project that aims to bring camera control and world creation to EBitEngine with ease!

## Planned Features
* Free camera movement across a landscape from a top-down view
* Chunk creation and generation for the ability to create infinitely scaleable worlds
* Ease-of-use functions to move the camera as needed
* Ability to import a tileset and to be able to immediately create the world in view. Possibly a 2d array?

## Why Qosmos?
EBitEngine does not have integrated Camera support. This means that if you want to build a game that goes beyond a simple one-page game, you have to do a lot of work. Qosmos aims to mitigate the struggle for this, allowing for quick and easy camera management and game world creation.

## Currently Finished Features
* Basic Camera creation and movement. Uses WASD
* Tile system (which will eventually be replaced with a sprite system).

## Future Features
* Chunk system (and chunk loading)
* Camera zoom
* Search algorithm to find the tiles that are within view of the screen.
